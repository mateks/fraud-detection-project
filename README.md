# Financial Fraud Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis pipeline focused on **detecting fraudulent financial transactions** using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The dataset used contains various types of bank transactions labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent. The goal is to explore, clean, and analyze the data to identify patterns of fraud and build an interactive dashboard for monitoring suspicious activities.

The project aligns well with real-world banking and fintech use cases, showcasing skills relevant to Python development, data analysis, and business intelligence.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition & Exploration:**  
   Download and load raw transaction data, perform initial data inspection and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, missing values, and fraud patterns.

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**  
   Clean missing or inconsistent data, convert data types, encode categorical variables, and create new features to enhance model interpretability.

3. **Fraud Analysis & Detection:**  
   Analyze fraudulent transactions, identify key patterns and trends, and implement simple rule-based detection methods.

4. **Database Integration & SQL Queries:**  
   Load cleaned data into an SQL database, perform advanced queries to extract business insights related to fraudulent activities.

5. **Visualization & Dashboarding:**  
   Build an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs), transaction trends, and fraud heatmaps.
